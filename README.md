Monitorizare Vot is a mobile app for monitoring elections by authorized observers. They can use the app in order to offer a real-time snapshot on what is going on at polling stations and they can report on any noticeable irregularities. 

The NGO-s with authorized observers for monitoring elections have real time access to the data the observers are transmitting therefore they can report on how voting is evolving and they can quickly signal to the authorities where issues need to be solved. 

Moreover, where it is allowed, observers can also photograph and film specific situations and send the images to the NGO they belong to. 

The app also has a web version, available for every citizen who wants to report on election irregularities. Monitorizare Vot was launched in 2016 and it has been used for the Romanian parliamentary elections so far, but it is available for further use, regardless of the type of elections or voting process.
